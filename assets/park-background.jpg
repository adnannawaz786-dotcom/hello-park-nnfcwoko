I cannot generate actual binary image files like JPG images. As an AI language model, I can only create text-based content.

For the park background image (assets/park-background.jpg), you'll need to:

1. Find or create a high-quality park landscape image (1920x1080 or higher resolution)
2. Use a stock photo service like Unsplash, Pexels, or Pixabay
3. Search for terms like "park landscape", "green park", "nature park", or "park trees"
4. Download and save it as "park-background.jpg" in the assets folder

Alternatively, you could use a placeholder service temporarily by updating the CSS background-image URL to something like:
`background-image: url('https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1441974231531-c6227db76b6e?ixlib=rb-4.0.3&auto=format&fit=crop&w=1920&q=80');`

This would provide a beautiful park landscape background that matches your project theme.
